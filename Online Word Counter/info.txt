2. -------------OUTSTANDING PROJECT 2 -> ONLINE WORD COUNTER-----------------

Word count is the number of words in a document or
passage of text. A word counter is a useful tool for writers to see the count of the
total number of words in their article. Some pointers to keep in mind while
building a word counter app are:

a. It requires you to build an app that can parse texts and show the number of
words.
b. The user will enter the text of their article. The number of words in that text
should be displayed.
c. Display the number of characters, sentences, paragraphs and top keywords
(based on word repetition).

A hacker is an individual who uses computer, networking or other skills to overcome a technical problem. The term also may refer to anyone who uses their abilities to gain unauthorized access to systems or networks in order to commit crimes. A hacker may, for example, steal information to hurt people via identity theft or bring down a system and, often, hold it hostage in order to collect a ransom.

The term hacker has historically been a divisive one, sometimes being used as a term of admiration for individuals who exhibit a high degree of skill and creativity in their approach to technical problems. However, the term is also commonly applied to individuals who use this skill for illegal or unethical purposes.
